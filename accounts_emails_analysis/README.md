In this SQL project we collect data to analyze account creation dynamics and user activity by email, such as sending, opening, and clicking.
We also evaluate behavior in categories such as sending interval, account verification, and subscription status.
This information enables us to compare activity between countries, identify key markets, and categorize users based on various criteria.
